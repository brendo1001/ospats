Some notes.

Package established 19/07/16

The ospats function performs optimal stratification of a gridded or mapped sampling domain 
given predictions and associated prediction uncertainties. An easier way to describe the input is a digital
soil map and assocaited prediciton variances. 

R code was orginally interpreted from Matlab code that was i believe developed by Jaap de Gruijter and Budiman Minasny

The first go of the function is exactly as is from the original matlab code.

Nicolas Saby provided a variant routine where the reallocation involved a simulated annealing to better
explore the solutions and avoid getting a solution stuck in a rut. Ideally irrespective of the starting solution
the final solution (stratification) should always be the same or very similar. The annealing schedule seems to be a 
good approach to do this than before where the solution was pretty much railroaded from previous allocations.

The functions incorporates some neat speed ups in terms of some custom c++ code. Spent some time getting my head around 
this.

There are many things to do to get this package in working order:

1. get on top of the documentation. There are many elements to this
2. put a data set into the package
3. Need to explore the option of whether the user can specify annealing or 'railroad' solutions. I think it
would be useful to have both options available. 


###27/07/16 (malone)
- Getting on top of the documentation. Still need to touch up the ospats one a bit more
- included data into the package, but need to write some documentation for it.
- should also include the cum sq function ino the package to (and with associated manual)
